1. Restart apache/nginx webserver from a webpage.
-> As apache/nginx runs under access to restart Apache via the sudo command.
So need to edit /etc/sudoers file and add lines similar to the following:

Cmnd_Alias      RESTART_APACHE = service httpd restart
www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: RESTART_APACHE

so that we don't need to add sudo before the command in the script which will be run through a webpage
in php <?php exec('service httpd restart'); ?>
